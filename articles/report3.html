<p>Grouping crashes together at a small spatial scale help to identify crash hot spots, areas where crashes happen unusually often. To this end crash data for the last 10 years was rasterised to a 500m grid. With each raster a single pixel covers a 500m x 500m area and contains a single value, for example, the number of people killed in that area in 2018. It is also possible to create a stack of multiple raster layers to represent a chaining variable, such as time.</p>
<p>We created twelve raster stacks with each stack covering the years ten years of available data 2010 to 2019. Each raster stack was created for the whole of Great Britain.</p>

<!-- This section is around 500 words -->
<p>To estimate the spatial distribution of cycling activity, measured in km per year, we started with data from the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT).
The Route Network layer in the PCT provides an indication of the number of commuter cyclists on different parts of the network, based on 2011 Census data reporting the number of people travelling between small (LSOA, average population ~2000) zones by mode of travel.
The route network in the PCT represents the ‘fastest’ routes for cycling between these LSOA zones and is not therefore designed to represent where cycling takes place (there are may be some links on the route network where the people prefer a slower but safer route).</p>
<p>Converting the spatial network representation of cycling to a spatial grid has the advantage of ‘smoothing’ out cycling activity across cities and allowing cycling levels to be presented in a form that is directly comparable with the crash data, which as also assigned to the spatial grid, as described in Section <a href="#collision">2.1</a>.
The three main steps were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Break-up long route network segments so that only segments with a length of 200 m or less remained.
To do this we initially solved the problem in R, developing the function <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr/reference/line_breakup.html"><code>line_breakup()</code></a> in the <code>stplanr</code> package for the purpose.
After realising that this implementation would take several hours to complete on the national route network, we opted for a more computationally efficient approach that used R’s interface to GIS algorithms in the <code>qgisprocess</code> package.</li>
<li>Calculate the distance cycled, in km per year, on each of the shortened segments on the updated route networks as follows: <span class="math display">\[
d_y = t_s * t_y * d_s
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d_y\)</span> is distance cycled per year per segment, <span class="math inline">\(t_s\)</span> is the number of trips per segment, <span class="math inline">\(t_y\)</span> is the number of trips in either direction made, on average, per year and <span class="math inline">\(d_s\)</span> is the distance of each segment.
<span class="math inline">\(t_s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d_s\)</span> are taken directly from the PCT and <span class="math inline">\(t_y\)</span> was set to 253 commute trips per day multiplied by two, based on guidance from <span class="citation">Department for Transport (2020)</span> and based on the fact that the PCT counts only record cycling flows in one direction.
<a href="https://github.com/saferactive/saferactive/blob/master/code/rasters-rnet.R#L56">Summing</a> these values for all route network segments across England and Wales yielded a total of 1.1 billion km cycled in 2011, roughly a quarter of the 4.5 billion km cycled by any mode in England and Wales according to the National Travel Survey (see table NTS0303 and analysis in the script <a href="https://github.com/saferactive/saferactive/blob/master/code/nts-national-distance-cycled-year.R"><code>nts-national-distance-cycled-year.R</code></a> for details).</li>
<li>Add the total distance cycled of each segment per grid cell, based on the centre point (centroid) of each segment of 200 m or less.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results are shown in Figure <a href="#fig:cycled-yr">2.1</a>.</p>

<a href="#modelling-spatio-temporal-change-in-cycling-uptake-based-on-count-data" class="anchor"></a><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Modelling spatio-temporal change in cycling uptake based on count data</h2>
<p>Joey ~500 words</p>
<p>We have used two key data sources to model spatio-temporal change in cycling uptake.
The first is DfT count data.
This is open source data available from the Department for Transport website <a href="https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/downloads" class="uri">https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/downloads</a>.
While the raw data is available for the years 2000 - 2019, we have focused on the decade 2010-2019, since there is more consistency in the type of roads being surveyed over this time period.</p>
<p>The second data source is Transport for London cycle counts, collected as part of three data collection programmes, for Central London, Inner London and Outer London <a href="https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/" class="uri">https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/</a>.
There are other TfL count programmes focusing on specific interventions such as the cycle superhighways and Mini-Holland schemes; we have not used these to keep our results representative of London as a whole.
The Central London counts are available from 2014, but the other counts are only available from 2015 to 2019, so we have used this time period.</p>
<p>To make the best possible use of the available data, we have developed two models.
For change in cycling uptake over the years 2010-2015, we have a model based solely on the DfT counts.
For the years 2015-2019, our model combines both the DfT and TfL counts.
To assess change across the full decade, we combine these two models, computing changes since 2015 on top of the changes seen up to this point.</p>
<p>In Central London, four Survey waves are conducted per year, corresponding with the standard quarterly periods.
The final wave for which data is available is 2019 Q3.
Cycling uptake varies across the year, and TfL has produced seasonal adjustment factors to account for this.
We have used these adjustment factors to control for seasonality, and to calculate a mean annual count for each Central London site.
This better corresponds with the Inner and Outer London counts which are conducted annually, representing the second quaterly period (April to June).
We used the Q2 adjustment factor to normalise these counts.</p>
<p>Our primary spatial model of cycling potential is derived from the Propensity to Cycle Tool, with this count data being used to model changes through time.
As part of the data cleaning process, we made efforts to correspond closely with the Propensity to Cycle Tool methodologies.
This included combining bi-directional data to get a single measure of cycle volume per site, similarly to the Propensity to Cycle Tool which combines journeys in both directions between a common origin and destination.
The TfL counts run from 06:00 to 22:00, but we only used counts from the commuter hours of 07:00 - 10:00 and 16:00 - 19:00, since the PCT data is for travel to work only.</p>
<p>GAM models were produced using splines to represent temporal and spatial change in cycling levels.
Temporal change is modelled as a cubic regression spline for the term <code>year</code>.
We gave this 5 knots, a relatively low number, to prevent
Cubic regression splines are appropriate for variables with relatively low numbers of knots, spread evenly across the extent of the parameter values.</p>
<p>Space (eastings and northings) is modelled using a Duchon spline, which works well with two-dimensional parameters.
We used 100 knots, to allow more complex spatial patterns to be represented.</p>
<p>We are able to estimate spatio-temporal change in cycling uptake over a ten year period from 2010 to 2019.
This will involve using a GAM model of relative change in Annual Average Daily Flow of pedal cycles, based on data from DfT count points across England, Wales and Scotland.
The model includes smoothing terms for year and for space.
Using these parameters, predictions can be derived, generating a smoothed surface representing modelled change in AADF across time and space.
This allows us to obtain estimates of change in cycling uptake at the same spatial resolution as the collision data.</p>

<p>Joey ~500 words</p>
<p>We have examined the coefficient of determination (R squared), to investigate correlations between data sets.</p>
<p>For the years 2015-2019, the trends are quite different in TfL and DfT count points. As seen in Figure <a href="#fig:x"><strong>??</strong></a>, the TfL counts rise throughout this period, while the DfT counts peak in 2016 and fall thereafter.</p>
<p><img src="https://rstudio.robinlovelace.net/s/5c3af61ebe310325bfffb/files/saferactive/figures/peak-flow-trend-late-years.png"><!-- --></p>
<p>We have verified the GAM predictions against the raw TfL count data, to ensure we are representing the true variability of the data. This gives an R squared of 0.194, showing the extent to which the model is able to predict counts across London in the years 2015-2019 (see Figure <a href="#fig:xx"><strong>??</strong></a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://rstudio.robinlovelace.net/s/5c3af61ebe310325bfffb/files/saferactive/figures/peak-hour-correlation.png"><!-- --></p>
<p>Further validation work should include sensitivity analysis involving the exclusion of portions of the dataset, and the prediction of these excluded portions. We also need to obtain confidence intervals to constrain the cycling uptake predictions.</p>
<p>We should also investigate how correlations change with greater temporal and spatial aggregation of data points.</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#exploring-risk" class="anchor"></a><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Exploring risk</h2>
<p>Road crash data are spatially and temporally precise but also attribute-rich. The Stast19 dataset for example has many variables describing numerous aspects associated with road conditions and vehicle types. Exploratory visual analysis interfaces provide a mechanism for quickly investigating these.</p>
<p>As a quick way of illustrating this, below are bar charts displaying crash frequencies for all (left) and active casualties (right) by road speed classification. Crashes resulting in a KSI (fatal or serious injury) are dark red, those resulting a slight injury light red. It is not surprising that 30mph roads are the modal category of road for all crahses, but especially those involving active travel modes. A more interesting question is around how relative injury severity varies by road type and vehicle mode. To quickly investigate this we generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_plot">mosaic plots</a>, a sort of visual contingency table where plot width varies according to <em>absolute number</em> of crashes in this case and height according to <em>relative number</em> of crashes resulting in a KSI (e.g. the relative height of the dark red bars). Whilst the pattern implied by this layout again could be anticipated, it does demonstrate the obvious effect on injury severity of increasing road speed limits on KSI rates for crashes involving pedestrians and cyclists.</p>
<!-- Link to crashes on hierarchy of vulnerability:  -->
<!-- https://itsleeds.github.io/rrsrr/join.html#joining-vehicle-data -->
<!-- can we make total height of each bar proportional to total n. crashes? -->

</p>
</div>
<p>Once the code template for these plots is created, it is very easy to substitute in other variables that we think may be discriminating – lighting and surface condition (wetness). Here again we the see strong effect on relative injury severity. We do not advocate using these plots for decision-making, for example prioritising lighting and surface drainage over other candidate interventions, but instead for their application as a low-cost mechanism for initially proposing factors that might then be incorporayed into a more formal data analysis.</p>

<p>A benefit of using Mosaic plots for presenting categorical data such as this is that they are data rich. For example, we might extend this analysis to profile crashes by travel mode. In the plots below we focus on London. That cars are the modal vehicle category is to be expected, but it is again useful to emphasise the fact that relative injury severity increases with motorbikes and bikes and also that the vehicle-crash mix varies according to geographic context.</p>

<p>Inevitably when analysing road crash data we wish to make inferences about casualty rates through comparison – over time and by geographic areas. There are difficulties with doing this – comparing rates across areas (and time) – that are more idiosyncratic relating to the way in which road crash data are collected and choice of denominator, but also established problems in statistics – for example, uncertainties due to sampling size and multiple comparison.</p>
<p>Key to this work is incorporating appropriate denominators for estimating exposure, discussed above. However, we are also implementing visual data analysis approaches to uncertainty representation. For illustrative purposes below are maps of relative risk comparing relative injury severity ratio for crashes in each Police Force area against that which would be expected given the national average. Where a Police Force has an injury severity ratio greater than the national average it is red, less than the national average blue. The left-most map contains risk ratios derived from crash data between 2017-2019; in the middle we demonstrate how these have shifted year-on-year, with no adjustment made for CRASH and COPA re-coding and in the right-most map we represent model uncertainty by drawing year-on-year lines that result from a bootstrap resample. Whilst representing a full empirical bootstrap distribution may be one means of representing uncertainty, we are currently investigating others, for example <a href="https://medium.com/hci-design-at-uw/hypothetical-outcomes-plots-experiencing-the-uncertain-b9ea60d7c740">hypothetical outcome plots</a>, increasingly used in journalism and public-facing domains.</p>
